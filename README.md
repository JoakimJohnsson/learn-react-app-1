# A small React project

## Notes
When learning - I usually try to differ slightly from instructions. To make me think more clearly. 

Also - UX and Accessibility is always on my mind. So it's important for me to right the wrongs of the instructors 
in these fields. I do this by entering valid html markup instead of the one suggested by the instructor
and making some standard a11y-checking. I don't fix 100% of the errors or warnings,
but I think it's important to know that they're there...
